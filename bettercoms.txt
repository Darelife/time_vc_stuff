#is this the line causing the error?????? @android??
#oh...yeah i saw that..is it possible tho?oo..nice
#Nah, the error was cause the message converter thing is asynchronous, and __init__ is synchronous. I tried to bypass it using asyncio but that shit is too hard for me :pepecries:. In theory, yes, but in practice, idk how
            
# yes....the basic one is simpler, and imo easier to debug
#ight, time to use the naive method, I can't deal with this asyncio shit
